# Module 2: Data Models

---

## 2.1 Chapter Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Explain **data modeling** and why models are important
- List building blocks of data models
- Define **business rules** and their impact on design
- Outline major data models and their evolution
- Identify new data models and their purpose
- Classify data models by their abstraction level

---

## 2.2 Data Modeling and Data Models

- **Data modeling**: The process of designing a model that represents the data in a problem domain.
  - Is *iterative*—models are refined step by step.
- **Data model**: A simple, conceptual representation of real-world objects and relationships.
  - Helps database designers capture complexity and reduce errors.

**Prompt:**  
Imagine designing a database for an online bookstore. What information (entities, relationships) would you start modeling?

---

## 2.3 Importance of Data Models

- Data models help people **communicate**:
  - Programmers, managers, and users often see data differently.
- Creating a solid blueprint before making the database ensures it works for everyone.
- *Without a good model, database design is likely to fail.*

**Example:**  
The finance manager and developer may each view customer data differently—data models create a common language.

---

## 2.4 Basic Building Blocks

- **Entity**: Object of interest (person, place, thing, event).
- **Attribute**: Characteristic of an entity.
- **Relationship**: Association among entities.
- **Constraint**: Rule or restriction on data.

**Types of Relationships:**
- **One-to-many (1:M):** One customer can have many orders.
- **Many-to-many (M:N):** Students register for many classes; classes have many students.
- **One-to-one (1:1):** One person, one passport.

**Prompt:**  
List entities and their relationships for a college registration system.

---

## 2.5 Constraints

- Constraints ensure **data integrity**.
- Expressed as rules (e.g., “GPA must be between 0.00 and 4.00”).

**Example:**  
Each classroom must have only one teacher, an employee’s salary must be within defined limits.

---

## 2.6 Knowledge Check

**Q:** What is a relationship? Name its three types.  
**A:** An association among entities. Types: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many.

---

## 2.7 Business Rules

- **Business rule:** A clear policy, procedure, or principle specific to an organization.
- Define entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints.
- Should be concise, unambiguous, and widely understood.

**Examples:**
- “A customer may generate many invoices.”
- “An invoice is generated by only one customer.”

---

## 2.8 Discovering Business Rules

- Gathered from managers, policy documents, and company procedures.
- Crucial for standardizing how data is viewed and used.

**Prompt:**  
Interview a department manager—what business rules define how they manage data?

---

## 2.9 Translating Business Rules to Models

- Example:  
  Rule: “A customer may generate many invoices”—identifies Customer and Invoice entities and a one-to-many relationship.

---

## 2.10 Naming Conventions

- Use clear, descriptive names for entities and attributes.
- Prefix attributes with entity names for clarity (e.g., CUS_CREDIT_LIMIT).
- Good conventions make models easier to read and maintain.

---

## 2.11 The Evolution of Data Models

- Changing views over time shaped how databases work:
  - **Hierarchical Model:** Data organized like an upside-down tree (parent-child).
  - **Network Model:** More flexible and complex relationships.
  - **Relational Model:** Data viewed as tables (relations).
  - **Entity Relationship Model (ERM):** Graphical diagrams for entities & relationships.
  - **Object-Oriented Model:** Data and behavior combined as objects.

---

## 2.12 Relational Model

- Based on **relations**—two-dimensional tables (rows = tuples, columns = attributes).
- Uses powerful RDBMS software to manage tables.
- SQL provides access and manipulation.

**Prompt:**  
Compare tables in Excel to database tables. How are they similar, and how are they different?

---

## 2.13 Entity Relationship Model (ERM)

- Visual tool: **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).**
- Common notations: Chen, Crow’s Foot, UML class diagrams.
- Shows entities (boxes), attributes, and relationships.

**Activity:**  
Draw an ERD for a simple library database (books, authors, borrowers).

---

## 2.14 Object-Oriented and Extended Models

- **Object-Oriented Data Model (OODM):** Data as objects, with attributes and methods.
- **Class:** A set of similar objects; supports inheritance.
- **O/R DBMS:** Combines relational and object features.
- **XML:** Standard for storing and exchanging structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

---

## 2.15 Emerging Data Models - Big Data & NoSQL

- **IoT**: Many devices creating huge amounts of data.
- **Big Data:** Focus on Volume, Velocity, Variety (**3 Vs**).
- **Hadoop, NoSQL:** Tools for distributed, scalable storage and analytics.

**Prompt:**  
Why can't traditional relational databases handle all IoT data efficiently?

---

## 2.16 NoSQL Database Characteristics

- Not strictly relational or SQL-based.
- Support distributed architecture, scalability, and availability.
- Handle sparse, massive data.
- Prioritize performance over transaction consistency.

---

## 2.17 Degrees of Data Abstraction

- **External Model:** End user's view—specific to units in the organization.
- **Conceptual Model:** Global view—covers the whole organization.
- **Internal Model:** As seen by the DBMS—software dependent.
- **Physical Model:** How data is stored physically—hardware & software dependent.

**Prompt:**  
Draw a diagram showing these four abstraction levels for a university database.

---

## 2.18 Knowledge Checks

- **Q:** What does “logical independence” mean?  
  **A:** The ability to change the internal model without affecting the conceptual model.
- **Q:** What does “3 Vs” mean in Big Data?  
  **A:** Volume, Velocity, Variety.

---

## 2.19 Summary

- Data modeling is vital for communicating and designing effective databases.
- Models use entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints.
- Business rules are essential to building meaningful databases.
- Data models have evolved; new ones solve emerging needs.
- Data abstraction makes database design flexible and organized.

---

## 2.20 Discussion Prompts

- Why does starting with a good data model make building databases easier?
- Where could business rules help avoid data errors in a school, hospital, or business?
- Which data abstraction level seems most important—and why?
