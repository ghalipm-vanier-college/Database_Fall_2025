# Module 2: Data Models

---

## 2.1 Chapter Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Explain **data modeling** and why models are important
- List building blocks of data models
- Define **business rules** and their impact on design
- Outline major data models and their evolution
- Identify new data models and their purpose
- Classify data models by their abstraction level

---

## 2.2 Data Modeling and Data Models

- **Data modeling**: The process of designing a model that represents the data in a problem domain.
  - Is *iterative*‚Äîmodels are refined step by step.
- **Data model**: A simple, conceptual representation of real-world objects and relationships.
  - Helps database designers capture complexity and reduce errors.

**Prompt:**  
Imagine designing a database for an online bookstore. What information (entities, relationships) would you start modeling?

---

## 2.3 Importance of Data Models

- Data models help people **communicate**:
  - Programmers, managers, and users often see data differently.
- Creating a solid blueprint before making the database ensures it works for everyone.
- *Without a good model, database design is likely to fail.*

**Example:**  
The finance manager and developer may each view customer data differently‚Äîdata models create a common language.

---

## 2.4 Basic Building Blocks

- **Entity**: Object of interest (person, place, thing, event).
- **Attribute**: Characteristic of an entity.
- **Relationship**: Association among entities.
- **Constraint**: Rule or restriction on data.

**Types of Relationships:**
- **One-to-many (1:M):** One customer can have many orders.
- **Many-to-many (M:N):** Students register for many classes; classes have many students.
- **One-to-one (1:1):** One person, one passport.

**Prompt:**  
List entities and their relationships for a college registration system.

---

## 2.5 Constraints

- Constraints ensure **data integrity**.
- Expressed as rules (e.g., ‚ÄúGPA must be between 0.00 and 4.00‚Äù).

**Example:**  
Each classroom must have only one teacher, an employee‚Äôs salary must be within defined limits.

---

## 2.6 Knowledge Check

**Q:** What is a relationship? Name its three types.  
**A:** An association among entities. Types: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many.

---

## 2.7 Business Rules

- **Business rule:** A clear policy, procedure, or principle specific to an organization.
- Define entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints.
- Should be concise, unambiguous, and widely understood.

**Examples:**
- ‚ÄúA customer may generate many invoices.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúAn invoice is generated by only one customer.‚Äù

---

## 2.8 Discovering Business Rules

- Gathered from managers, policy documents, and company procedures.
- Crucial for standardizing how data is viewed and used.

**Prompt:**  
Interview a department manager‚Äîwhat business rules define how they manage data?

---

## 2.9 Translating Business Rules to Models

- Example:  
  Rule: ‚ÄúA customer may generate many invoices‚Äù‚Äîidentifies Customer and Invoice entities and a one-to-many relationship.

---

## 2.10 Naming Conventions

- Use clear, descriptive names for entities and attributes.
- Prefix attributes with entity names for clarity (e.g., CUS_CREDIT_LIMIT).
- Good conventions make models easier to read and maintain.

---

## 2.11 The Evolution of Data Models

- Changing views over time shaped how databases work:
  - **Hierarchical Model:** Data organized like an upside-down tree (parent-child).
  - **Network Model:** More flexible and complex relationships.
  - **Relational Model:** Data viewed as tables (relations).
  - **Entity Relationship Model (ERM):** Graphical diagrams for entities & relationships.
  - **Object-Oriented Model:** Data and behavior combined as objects.

---

## 2.12 Relational Model

- Based on **relations**‚Äîtwo-dimensional tables (rows = tuples, columns = attributes).
- Uses powerful RDBMS software to manage tables.
- SQL provides access and manipulation.

* Any SQL-based relational database application involves the following three parts:
     - **User Interface (UI)**
    The UI enables users to interact with the database via graphical apps, command-line tools, or APIs to query and manage data.
    
    
    
     - **Database Tables**
    Data is stored in structured, relational tables with rows and columns, designed for easy access and manipulation.
    
    
    
     - **SQL Engine**
    The SQL engine processes queries, executes operations (e.g., retrieve, insert, update, delete), and ensures data integrity.

**Prompt:**  
Compare tables in Excel to database tables. How are they similar, and how are they different?

---

## 2.13 Entity Relationship Model (ERM)

* Conceptual Simplicity
  * Complex database design requires clear, simple concepts to achieve successful outcomes.

* Graphical Tools for Design
  * Database designers use graphical tools to visually represent entities and their relationships.

* **Entity Relationship Model (ERM)**
  * The ERM provides a framework for modeling database entities and relationships.
  * Foundation of Relational Design
  * The ERM and relational data model together form the basis for structured database design.

* Visual tool: **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).**
  * An ERD uses graphical symbols to represent database components, entities, and their relationships.
  * Common notations: **Chen, Crow‚Äôs Foot, UML(the Unified Modeling Language) class diagrams**.
  * Shows entities (boxes), attributes, and relationships.

<br>


**Activity:**  
Draw an ERD for a simple library database (books, authors, borrowers).

---

## 2.14 Object-Oriented and Extended Models

- **Object-Oriented Data Model (OODM):** Data as objects, with attributes and methods.
- **Class:** A set of similar objects; supports inheritance.
- **O/R DBMS:** Combines relational and object features.
- **XML:** Standard for storing and exchanging structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

## 2.15 Emerging Data Models - Big Data & NoSQL

- **IoT**: Many devices creating huge amounts of data.
- **Big Data:** Focus on Volume, Velocity, Variety (**3 Vs**).
- **Hadoop, NoSQL:** Tools for distributed, scalable storage and analytics.
