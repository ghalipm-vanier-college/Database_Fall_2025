# Module 01: Introduction to Database Systems

## 1.1 Chapter Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Define the difference between data and information.  
- Describe what a database is, its various types, and why databases are valuable for decision-making.  
- Explain the importance of database design.  
- Understand how modern databases evolved from file systems.  
- Identify flaws in traditional file system data management.  
- Outline the main components of a database system.  
- Describe the main functions of a database management system (DBMS).

## 1.2 Data vs Information
- **Data**: Raw facts that have *not been processed* to reveal meaning.  
- **Information**: The *result of processing raw data* with context, making it meaningful.  
- Information builds on data, which in turn builds knowledge.  
- Good decision-making requires **accurate, relevant, and timely information**.  

**Example:**  
- Data: A list of student test scores → `[75, 89, 92, 68]`  
- Information: The class average is 81.  
- Knowledge: The class performed above expectations compared to last year.  

**Think About:** What "raw facts" from your daily routine can become useful information with context?

## 1.3 Introducing the Database
- A **database** is a shared, integrated computer structure that stores *end-user data* and *metadata*.  
- **End-user data**: Raw facts of interest to the user (e.g., customer names or transactions).  
- **Metadata**: *Data about data*, providing context and relationships.  
- A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is a set of programs that:  
  - Manages the database structure.  
  - Controls access to the data.  
  - Presents users with a unified view of the data.  

**Example:**  
- In a **university system**, students, courses, and grades are entities. A DBMS integrates them so advisors can view a student's complete academic record in one place.

## 1.4 Advantages of Using a DBMS
- Improved **data sharing**  
- Improved **data security**  
- Better **data integration** across departments  
- Reduced **data inconsistency**  
- Faster **data access for decision-making**  
- Increased **end-user productivity**

**Class Activity:**  
Imagine every university department kept its own file cabinets instead of sharing a database.  
- What problems could arise when a student changes their phone number?

## 1.5 Types of Databases  

### By Number of Users
- **Single-user**: One person at a time (e.g., desktop database).  
- **Multi-user**: Many people at once (e.g., enterprise database for a bank).  

### By Location
- **Centralized**: Data stored at one site.  
- **Distributed**: Data spread across multiple sites.  
- **Cloud-based**: Managed by cloud services (e.g., AWS RDS, Google BigQuery).  

### By Data Type & Purpose
- **General-purpose**: Multiple uses (e.g., MS Access for projects).  
- **Discipline-specific**: Narrow focus (e.g., PubMed for medical research).  
- **Operational**: Supports daily transactions.  
- **Analytical**: Stores historical data for reporting and BI (databases + OLAP: Online Analytical Processing)

### By Data Structure
- **Structured**: Organized in tables (e.g., SQL databases).  
- **Unstructured**: Raw form (e.g., text files, multimedia).  
- **Semi-structured**: Partial organization (e.g., JSON, XML).  
- **XML databases** handle unstructured XML documents.

## 1.6 Problems with File System Data Processing
Traditional file systems cause challenges:  
- **Structural dependence**: A file’s structure tightly ties to programs accessing it. Any change breaks multiple applications.  
- **Data dependence**: Physical storage details must be known by programs.  
- **Data redundancy**: Duplicated data leads to inconsistencies and errors (so-called *“islands of information”*).  
- **Data anomalies**: Inconsistent updates or deletions cause system errors.

**Mini-Exercise:**  
- If a student changes their major, how would storing this data in separate departmental spreadsheets cause redundancy or anomalies?

## 1.7 The Database System Environment
A complete database system consists of:  
1. **Hardware**: Physical devices.  
2. **Software**: DBMS and related applications.  
3. **People**: Designers, administrators, and end-users.  
4. **Procedures**: Rules for use and management.  
5. **Data**: Raw facts and metadata.

## 1.8 DBMS Functions
A DBMS provides crucial support for managing databases:  
- **Data Dictionary Management**: Stores definitions and relationships of data.  
- **Data Storage Management**: Organizes physical storage of information.  
- **Data Transformation/Presentation**: Converts data for the user’s logical view.  
- **Security Management**: Ensures user-level security and privacy.  
- **Multiuser Access Control**: Supports concurrency without corruption.  
- **Backup/Recovery Management**: Prevents data loss.  
- **Integrity Management**: Enforces rules and prevents redundancy.  
- **Query Languages**: Provides means to retrieve data (e.g., **SQL**).  

**Real-Life Example:**  
- In an **online banking system**, a DBMS ensures:  
  - Security (you only see *your* account).  
  - Multiuser access (thousands can log in simultaneously).  
  - Backup/recovery (transactions aren’t lost if the system crashes).

## Discussion Questions
1. Why is “data without context” less useful for decision-making?  
2. What types of databases do apps like Netflix, Amazon, or Spotify rely on?  
3. How do DBMS functions like backup and recovery impact businesses during failures?
